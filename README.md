# Challenge 1
---

This assignment demonstrates how to use the import method to import from another script. I have created a measurement conversion app which asks the user for an integer value and then asks which formula he/she would like to convert from then to. The fuction is located on the 'lib_num.py' file where as the user input application is located on the 'main.py' file. For better user expirience, I have added the following message prompt.
```
Values available for conversion: 
 'cm to m'       'm to cm' 
 'cm to mm'      'mm to cm' 
 'mm to m'       'm to mm' 
 'ft to cm'      'ft to inch'         
 'inch to cm'    'inch to mm'
Enter the a numeric value: 
```


## Challenge Requirements

#### First Task
1. First Python File: Utility File
   * You can choose any name for this python file
   * This file will be just a utility file (library) that contains a list of function(s), variables, etc..
   * Contain at least one function (def …), with any name and any task. 
   * The function name should reflect the function job (don’t worry about using packages: from
     import for now)
   * This file is only for creating the functions (We don’t call/run the function here), these will be
     called in another file which is the main python to run our application
   * Hint: you can test your function(s) in this file by calling/running them inside this file, then you
     will need to delete the calling of your function
   
2. Second Python File: Main App File
   * You can choose any name for this python file
   * This file is the main one that represent our application and you will run in the terminal
   * Using any one of the import commands (3 ways) to call or import the function(s) from your first
     python file

#### Second Task
   * Commit this folder to your GitHub account
   * Add ReadMe file with some content about your simple challenge
   * You will need to share with us your (Screen and Mic) and show us your code and the result
